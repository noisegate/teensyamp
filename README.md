# teensyamp

[This](http://rdimitrov.twistedsanity.net/blog/show.php?entry=Microcontroller%20Class%20D%20Amplifier,%20Rev2) insired me to make my own. But then with a teensy 3.2. This is my 1st project with ARM ucontroller, so I am learning while doing this project. 

##So..
the idea is to convert an analog (audio) signal to a digital value and use that to set a PWM which drives an H-bridge. This is a ADC-DAC conversion.
